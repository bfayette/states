# States machine (Initial work. In Progress)
Need to build a tool simple and stateless state machine that can be reusable accross project.

Tighly coupled to an approbation system. Refactor will be needed to make it useable in other contexts. Work in progress. 
*Any dependency to lib need to be removed. Just java standard api.
*Classes and packages renamed are expected
*Suggestions are welcomed
