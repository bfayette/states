# States machine (Initial work. In Progress)
Try to build a simple tool, a stateless state machine.

* Tighly coupled to an existing approbation system. Refactor will be needed to make it useable in other contexts. Work in progress. 
  * Any dependency to lib need to be removed. Just java standard api.
  * Classes and packages renamed are expected
  * Suggestions are welcomed
